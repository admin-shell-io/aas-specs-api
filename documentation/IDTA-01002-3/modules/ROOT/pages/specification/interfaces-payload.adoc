= Data Types for Payload

== General

For metamodel elements like AssetAdministrationShell, Submodel, Identifier, etc. that are specified in Part 1 xref:bibliography.adoc#bib1[[1\]], please refer to the specification in Bibliography. The AAS package format and the AAS Package type are defined in Part 5 xref:bibliography.adoc#bib4[[4\]]. This clause only defines additional classes that are needed for communication with the API.

[#metamodel-specification-details]
== Metamodel Specification Details

The following type definitions are used to describe specific metamodel elements like Asset Administration Shells and submodels regarding their network and deployment configuration. They use certain attributes copied from the model element itself to describe it – hence the name _Descriptor_.

[#descriptor]
=== Descriptor

[.table-with-appendix-table]

|===


====
Note: the cardinality restriction for AssetAdministrationShellDescriptor/endpoint (optional: 0..*) allows a provider to skip the declaration of the location of an AssetAdministrationShell and directly point to the endpoints of the contained Submodels through the path AssetAdministrationShellDescriptor/submodelDescriptor-> SubmodelDescriptor/endpoint. A client, therefore, might decide to skip the lookup on the AssetAdministrationShell. Nevertheless, in case the information contained in the AssetAdministrationShellDescriptor deviates from the related AssetAdministrationShell, or attributes are missing, the AssetAdministrationShell is always the source of truth.

=== Query Results

Result elements of AAS queries depend on the declared output selector and the target of the query. Possible targets are Asset Administration Shells, Submodels, Concept Descriptions, Asset Administration Shell Descriptors, and Submodel Descriptors. In accordance, also these objects are returned in the Query Result. In addition, their representation can be controlled via the select statements of the input query, e.g., by only selecting the identifiers of the respective objects rather than the whole content.

=== Status Code, Error Handling & Result Messages 

This clause deals with the error and result handling of an operation’s execution in a technology-independent manner.

The first clause covers generic status codes that are returned on each request, independent of the operation’s success or failure. The subsequent clause describes the result object that is returned in case of failure.

[[StatusCode]]
==== Generic Status Codes

Successful operations return one of the success status codes and their respective payload. Unsuccessful operations return one of the failure status codes and a result object as defined in Clause 0.

Table 4 shows generic status codes returned to the requester. Additionally, the table indicates whether a specific status code comes with a result object in the returned payload.

|ClientErrorResourceNotFound |Resource not found |Yes
|ClientResourceConflict |Conflict-creating resource (resource already exists) |Yes
|ServerInternalError |Unexpected error |Yes
|ServerErrorBadGateway |Bad gateway |Yes

In case of a failed operation execution, a result object [.underline]#shall be returned# containing more information about the reasons why the operation failed to execute.
