= Introduction

This document defines APIs for enabling the access to the information provided by an Asset Administration Shell.
The underlying information model is as defined in xref:bibliography.adoc#bib1[[1\]].

Since an API can be specified in different technologies like HTTP/REST, MQTT and OPC UA, the specification offers a technology-neutral specification of the interfaces.

While Part 5 of the specification series of the Asset Administration Shell xref:bibliography.adoc#bib4[[4\]] mainly considered file exchange, this specification focuses on the API that allows online access to information provided by the AAS (see <<aas-info-exchange-types>>).
