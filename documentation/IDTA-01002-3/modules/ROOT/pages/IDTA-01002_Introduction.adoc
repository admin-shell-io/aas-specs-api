= Introduction

This document defines APIs for enabling the access to the information provided by an Asset Administration Shell. The underlying information model is as defined in xref:IDTA-01002_Bibliography.adoc#bib1[[1\]].

Since an API can be specified in different technologies like HTTP/REST, MQTT and OPC UA, the specification offers a technology-neutral specification of the interfaces.

While Part 5 of the specification series of the Asset Administration Shell xref:IDTA-01002_Bibliography.adoc#bib3[[3\]] mainly considered file exchange, this specification focuses on the API that allows online access to information provided by the AAS (see Figure 1).
