= API Code Generation

SwaggerHub includes the possibility to generate code from an API, e.g. for C# .NET:

image:swaggerhub-gen-code.png[width=203,height=110]

API code can be created for both servers and clients in various programming languages.

Known issues include the following:

* When generating the aspnetcore server stub for the AssetAdministrationShellEnvironmentApi, the operation PutFileByPath is not generated automatically and must be added manually.
* When generating the aspnetcore server stub for the AasxFileServerInterfaceApi, the operations PostAASXPackage and PutAASXByPackageId are not generated automatically and must be added manually.

The SwaggerHub code generator development team is not part of the AAS activities and has been informed about these issues.
