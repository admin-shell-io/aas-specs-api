= Summary and Outlook 

This document specifies the interfaces for a single Asset Administration Shell and its Submodels, as well as for a repository of Asset Administration Shells.
Additionally, infrastructural interfaces like Registry and Discovery of a set of Asset Administration Shells are specified.

All interfaces are specified in a technology-neutral way before defining technology-specific APIs.

In this version of the specification, HTTP/REST APIs are defined and mapped to the technology-neutral specification as a frontrunner.

In subsequent versions of this specification, APIs using other technologies are planned to be supported, e.g. gRPC or MQTT.

Additionally, further interfaces, service specifications, and profiles may be defined.
